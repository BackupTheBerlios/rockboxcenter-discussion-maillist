Message-ID: <200808211523.03263.vonscheidt@googlemail.com>

Hey,

here are some collected ideas for the gui-development.
Comments and additions are welcome.

- insert the great logo from N3X0NIC
- divide between installation and data-transfer
- the dialogs should be kindly and easy, so also beginners understand them
- the status of the download should be displayed(http://forum.ubuntuusers.de/topic/python:-statusanzeige-fuer-download/?highlight=python+download)
- the data-transfer similary to make a playlist in Amarok
- create a wizard(setup-dialog) in which you can choose what you want to download and install
- For the music-management: possiblity to sort and copy the music-file via tag or filename(amarok-like)
- save the infos(tags, path) of the music-files in a database or a xml-file
- access to the amarok-database
- using lunars script to copy, convert and scale the pictures of amaroks database

Best Regards,

Johannes von Scheidt
